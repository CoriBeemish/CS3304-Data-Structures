Assignment 11

The goal of this assignment is to reinforce sorting algorithms. Specifically, the assignment is to do 
problem 13 on page 682 of the text.

13. In 1959, the American computer scientist
    Donald Shell invented a technique that can
    be used to speed up many different sorting
    algorithms. For this project, you will apply Shellâ€™s
    method to insertion sort.
    The basis of the technique is to get the items to
    move in big steps (rather than shifting elements to
    the next-higher index). These big-step shifts are
    done early in the algorithm, and they tend to put the
    array in nearly sorted order. Later in the algorithm,
    we use smaller steps (all the way down to steps of
    size one, just like an ordinary insertionsort). But by
    the time that the small steps are being taken, the
    array is nearly sorted, and thatâ€™s a situation where
    insertionsort is efficient.
    The choice of the various step sizes affects the
    performance of the algorithm, but one sequence that
    is empirically good starts at n/2, and each subsequent
    step size is about the previous size divided by
    2.2.
    The overall pseudocode is given here:
    
      ss = n/2;
      while (ss > 0)
      {
        Do an insertionsort on the elements
        data[0], data[ss], data[2*ss]...

        Also do an insertionsort on
        data[1], data[ss+1], data[2*ss+1]...
        
        And on
        data[2], data[ss+2], data[2*ss+2]...
        
        And so on. The last little insertionsort that
        you do starts at data[ss-1].
        
        ss = round ss/2.2 to nearest integer;
      }
