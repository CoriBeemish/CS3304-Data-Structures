Assignment 9

The goal of this assignment is to reinforce the tree data structure in C++. Specifically, the assignment is to do the following:
Construct a function that will display a binary tree by levels (each level on a separate line). If there is no node at a position 
in a level, then the function should display NULL. Only levels that contain at least 1 datum should be displayed.
