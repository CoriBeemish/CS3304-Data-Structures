Assignment 2

The goal of assignment 1 is to reinforce classes in C++. Specifically, the assignment is to do problems 16 and 17 on 
page 95 of the text with the following modifications.

- For problem 16, do not construct an interactive program. Instead, create a test program using assertions.
- For problem 17, the display functions should be not be friend functions â€“ just regular free functions.

For both problems, the class style of documentation (preconditions and postconditions) with each function protecting itself 
need to be used. The test program needs to check all the functionality of each class using assertions.
