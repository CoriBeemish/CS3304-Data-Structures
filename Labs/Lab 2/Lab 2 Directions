Lab 2

The purpose of this lab is to reinforce the concept of constructing a class in C++. 
Specifically, the problem is to do problem 19 on page 95 of the text.

    19. Write a class for complex numbers. A complex
    number has the form a + bi, where a
    and b are real numbers and i is the square
    root of -1. We refer to a as the real part and b as
    the imaginary part of the number. The class should
    have two data members to represent the real and
    imaginary numbers; the constructor takes two arguments
    to set these members. Discuss and implement
    other appropriate operators for this class.
