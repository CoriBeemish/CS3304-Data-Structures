Lab 6

The purpose of this lab is to help reinforce container class concepts and linked list concepts in C++. 
Specifically, the lab is to do problem 5.5 on page 287 of the text. 

   5.5. Write a function that has two linked-list
	head pointers as parameters. Assume that the
	linked list’s items are ordered by the < operator.
	On each list, every item is less than the next item on
	the same list. The function should create a new
	linked list that contains all the items on both lists,
	and the new linked list should also be ordered (so
	that every item is less than the next item on the list).
	The new linked list should also eliminate duplicate
	items (i.e., if the same item appears on both input
	lists, then only one copy is placed in the newly constructed
	linked list). To eliminate duplicate items,
	you may assume that two items can be compared for
	equality using ==. The function should return a head
	pointer for the newly constructed linked list.
