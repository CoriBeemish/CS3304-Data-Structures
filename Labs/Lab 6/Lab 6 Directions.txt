Lab 6

The purpose of this lab is to help reinforce container class concepts and linked list concepts in C++. 
Specifically, the lab is to do problem 5.5 on page 287 of the text. 

   5.5. Write a function that has two linked-list
		head pointers as parameters. Assume that the
		linked listâ€™s items are ordered by the < operator.
		On each list, every item is less than the next item on
		the same list. The function should create a new
		linked list that contains all the items on both lists,
		and the new linked list should also be ordered (so
		that every item is less than the next item on the list).
		The new linked list should also eliminate duplicate
		items (i.e., if the same item appears on both input
		lists, then only one copy is placed in the newly constructed
		linked list). To eliminate duplicate items,
		you may assume that two items can be compared for
		equality using ==. The function should return a head
		pointer for the newly constructed linked list.
