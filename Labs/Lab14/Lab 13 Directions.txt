Lab 13

The purpose of this lab is to help reinforce sorting algorithms in C++.  Specifically, the lab is to 
problem 10 page 681 of the text. 

10.   A radix sort is a technique for sorting
	unsigned integers (or other data that has
	individual characters or digits).
	One version of radix sort works with a linked list
	of unsigned integers. In addition to the list that is being
	sorted, there are two extra lists called list0 and
	list1.
	  The algorithm begins by going through the list of
	elements to be sorted; every even number is transferred
	from the original list to the tail of list0, and
	every odd number is transferred to the tail of list1.
	(If you are using the STL list class, you may remove
	an item from the head of a list with the
	pop_front member function, and you may add a
	new node to the tail of a list with push_back.) After
	all numbers have been processed, put the two lists
	together (with list0 in front and list1 at the back),
	and then put the whole thing back in the original list.
	With the STL list class, this can be done in constant
	time with two splice statements shown here:
	
	  splice(original.begin( ), list1);
	  splice(original.begin( ), list0);
	
	In this code, original is the original list (that is
	empty before the two splices because we moved everything
	to list0 and list1).
	  The process of separating and splicing is repeated
	a second time, but now we separate based on the
	boolean expression ((n/2) % 2 == 0). And then
	we separate and splice using ((n/4) % 2 == 0).
	And so on with larger and larger divisors 8, 16,
	32, ... . The process stops when the divisor is bigger
	than the largest number in the list.
	  Here is one way to implement the algorithm:
	  const int MAX_ITERATIONS =
		sizeof(unsigned int)*8;
	  divisor= 1;
	  for (i = 0; i < MAX_ITERATIONS; ++i)
	  {
		Perform the separation and splice using
		using the ((n/divisor) % 2 == 0)
		to control the split.
		divisor = 2*divisor;
	  }
	To improve performance, you can break out of the
	loop if the divisor ever exceeds the largest number
	in the list. But if you don’t do so, the loop will still
	end when the divisor overflows the largest possible
	unsigned integer.
	  If you are familiar with the bit-shift operator >>
	on numbers, then a slightly more efficient expression
	is ((n >> i) % 2 == 0). Another efficient
	alternative uses the bitwise & operator (written with
	one & rather than &&): (n & divisor == 0).
	  The algorithm is quick: Each iteration of the loop
	takes O(n) time (where n is the size of the list), and
	the total number of iterations is about log2 m (where
	m is the maximum number in the list). Thus, the entire
	time is O(n log m).
