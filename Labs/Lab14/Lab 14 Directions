Lab 14

The purpose of this lab is to help reinforce graph algorithms in C++.  
Specifically, the lab is to problem 4 page 780 of the text.  

4. Implement a function with three arguments:
   a graph, a starting vertex number, and an
   ending vertex number. The function determines
   whether there is a directed path from the starting
   vertex to the ending vertex.
