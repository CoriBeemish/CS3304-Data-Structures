Lab 9

The purpose of this lab is to help reinforce tree implementations in C++. 
Specifically, the lab is to do problem #8 on page 538 of the text.

     8. Write a function that takes a binary search
	tree as input and produces a linked list of
	the entries, with the entries sorted (smallest
	entries at the front of the list and largest entries at the
	back). Hint: use in-order traversal.
