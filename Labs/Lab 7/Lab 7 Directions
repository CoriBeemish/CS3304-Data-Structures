Lab 7

The purpose of this lab is to help reinforce stack comments in C++. Specifically, the lab is to write 
a C++ program which will evaluate a post-fix expression. The 3 major components of the program are:
- get the postfix expression
- evaluate the postfix expression
- display the results

My suggestion is to implement the post-fix expression as a list of strings where each string is either 
an operand (integer in our case) or operator (4 standard arithmetic operators). Use the STL stack class and list class.
