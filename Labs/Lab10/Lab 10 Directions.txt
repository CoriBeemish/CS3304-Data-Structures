Lab 10

The purpose of this lab is to help reinforce tree implementations in C++.  Specifically, the lab is to 
implement the breadth-first algorithm for a binary tree.  Specifically, a new free function needs to added 
to the author's binary_tree_node class and the signature for this function should be
template <class Process, class BTNode> 
void breadthfirst(Process f, BTNode* node_ptr)

You need to test this function by printing a tree and summing the elements in a binary tree of integers.
